faq:
- question: "Why does AI forget what I told it?"
  answer: "The model itself doesn't learn from your chats. It only sees what's placed in its input for each reply. Long chats overflow that input, and memory features save only selected facts, so details that weren't saved or recently mentioned get lost."
- question: "Do LLMs have memory?"
  answer: "Not on their own. A language model's knowledge is fixed at training time, and each reply is computed from the text in its context window. Apps like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini add memory on top by storing facts or searching past chats and inserting the relevant parts."
- question: "Will AI memory get better?"
  answer: "It's improving, but slowly. Vendors keep adding features like ChatGPT's memory summary and Claude's per-project memory, yet a 2024 benchmark found commercial chat assistants still lost about 30% accuracy recalling information across long interactions."

**AI memory is so bad** because the model behind a chatbot doesn't remember anything by itself. It reads only the text placed in front of it for each reply. Long chats push old messages out, models handle long inputs unevenly, and memory features save just a selection of what you said. Each step drops information.

## What is AI memory?

**AI memory is everything a chatbot uses to recall information from outside the current reply: the recent conversation, saved facts, and searches over past chats.** The language model doesn't store your conversations in its weights. The app stores them and decides which pieces to feed back into the model's input, called the **context window**.

So when people say "the AI forgot," one of three things went wrong. The detail never got saved, it fell out of the context window, or it was in the window and the model missed it.

## Reason 1: The model doesn't learn from your chats

A language model's knowledge is fixed when training ends. Talking to it doesn't change it. Each reply is computed fresh from whatever text the app sends: system instructions, recent messages, and any memory the app chose to include.

That's why memory is a separate product feature. OpenAI describes ChatGPT's memory as something that can "remember relevant preferences and details from your chats and other available sources" ([OpenAI Memory FAQ](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8590148-memory-faq)). It's a layer the app adds, not something the model does. Turn it off, or use a temporary or incognito chat, and you're back to a model with no memory of you at all.

## Reason 2: The context window runs out

The context window has a fixed size. In a long chat, the app eventually has to drop or shorten older messages to make room for new ones. Character.AI's help center says it directly: "There is a limited amount of conversation context that the character can consider, so it will appear to forget things if they were not mentioned recently" ([Character.AI FAQ](https://support.character.ai/hc/en-us/articles/15063870278171-Why-do-Characters-forget-things)).

Everything competes for that space. A long character Definition, custom instructions, uploaded files and retrieved memories all take room from the actual conversation. This is the most common cause of "it forgot what I said an hour ago." How the window works is covered in [the context window of an LLM](/articles/context-window-of-an-llm/).

## Reason 3: Models use long inputs unevenly

A bigger window doesn't fix the problem. A 2023 study found that models do best when the relevant information is at the start or end of the input, and worse when it's in the middle ([Liu et al., "Lost in the Middle," TACL 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172)).

A 2025 Chroma report tested 18 models, including GPT-4.1, Claude 4 and Gemini 2.5, and found that "model performance consistently degrades with increasing input length," even on simple tasks ([Chroma, "Context Rot"](https://www.trychroma.com/research/context-rot)). Irrelevant but similar text made it worse. In a long chat full of related details, that's exactly the setup you get.

## Reason 4: Memory features save only a selection

Saved memory doesn't keep everything either. OpenAI says ChatGPT's memory "does not retain every detail from every conversation," and that ChatGPT looks for past context only "when it is likely to improve a response." If the app's retrieval step doesn't judge an old detail relevant, the model never sees it.

Benchmarks show the gap. **LongMemEval**, a 2024 benchmark of 500 questions over long chat histories, found that commercial chat assistants and long-context models showed "a 30% accuracy drop on memorizing information across sustained interactions" ([Wu et al., arXiv 2410.10813](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813)).

## Reason 5: Memory goes stale or gets blocked

Memory can also be wrong. Facts change: you moved, switched jobs, finished a project. When OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT's memory in June 2026, it said the goal was "reducing stale or contradictory saved memories" ([ChatGPT release notes](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes)), which tells you the old system had that problem.

Some forgetting is on purpose. Claude doesn't save sensitive topics like health, religion or politics unless you opt in ([Claude memory help](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11817273-using-claude-s-chat-search-and-memory-to-build-on-previous-context)). Memory may also be off by your settings, your workspace admin, or your region.

## Why AI forgets: symptoms, causes and fixes

| What you notice | Likely cause | What helps |
|---|---|---|
| Forgets something from earlier in the same long chat | Context window overflow | Restate it, pin it, or start a new chat with a summary |
| Forgets you between chats | Memory off, temporary chat, or not saved | Turn memory on; ask it to "remember" the fact |
| Remembers old, wrong facts | Stale saved memory | Edit or delete the memory in settings |
| Mixes up two projects | Shared memory across topics | Use projects with project-only memory |
| Ignores a fact you're sure it saved | Retrieval didn't pick it up | Mention it again or put it in custom instructions |

## How to get better memory from a chatbot

1. **Check memory is on.** In ChatGPT it's under Settings > Personalization > Memory; see [how to find ChatGPT memory](/articles/how-to-find-chatgpt-memory/).
2. **Say "remember this" for key facts.** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and Copilot all document saving facts on request.
3. **Put always-needed rules in custom instructions.** They're applied every time; memory is applied when the app thinks it's relevant.
4. **Keep long work in one project.** Project memory narrows what the model has to search.
5. **Start fresh with a summary.** When a chat gets very long, ask for a summary and paste it into a new chat.
6. **Review and prune memory.** Delete outdated entries so they don't contradict new ones.
7. **Pick an app with visible memory.** The [best chatbots for memory](/articles/best-chatbot-for-memory/) let you read and edit what's stored.

## How developers work around it

If you're building an AI agent or chatbot, you face the same limits and have to design memory yourself. The usual approach is a memory layer that stores facts from conversations, retrieves the relevant ones for each request, and updates or retires old ones. Open-source options include Mem0, Letta, Zep and [Hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight), an MIT-licensed agent memory system that reports results on LongMemEval. The design choices are covered in [how to give AI agents memory](/articles/how-to-give-ai-agents-memory/).
