faq:
- question: "What is the difference between short-term and long-term memory in agentic AI?"
  answer: "Short-term memory holds the current conversation or task and lasts for one thread; it lives in the agent's state and is limited by the context window. Long-term memory persists across threads and sessions in an external store, scoped per user or app, and only the relevant pieces are retrieved into each prompt."
- question: "How does information move from short-term to long-term memory in an AI agent?"
  answer: "The agent or a background job extracts durable facts, events or lessons from the conversation and writes them to a long-term store. On later turns, the agent searches that store and copies the relevant memories back into its short-term context. LangGraph calls these writes 'hot path' when they happen during the turn and 'background' when they happen after."
- question: "Can a long context window replace long-term memory?"
  answer: "No. A larger window delays the problem but resets with each new session and costs more per call. The LongMemEval benchmark found commercial assistants and long-context LLMs showed a 30% accuracy drop when recalling information across sustained interactions."

**Short-term and long-term memory in agentic AI** differ by scope. **Short-term memory** is the agent's state for one task: messages, tool results, the plan. It lives in the prompt and ends with the thread. **Long-term memory** lives in an external store, survives across sessions, and is retrieved selectively. Agents need both, plus a path that moves information between them.

This page compares the two side by side and shows how they connect in code. Each type has its own deep dive: [short-term memory in AI agents](/articles/short-term-memory-ai-agents/) and [AI agent long-term memory](/articles/ai-agent-long-term-memory/). The pillar, [AI agent memory explained](/articles/ai-agent-memory-explained/), covers the full taxonomy.

## What is the difference between short-term and long-term memory in agentic AI?

**Short-term memory is thread-scoped state that holds the current conversation and task, bounded by the context window and discarded when the thread ends. Long-term memory is cross-thread storage, scoped to a user, agent or organization, that persists indefinitely and is searched to bring relevant facts, events or rules into the current context.**

LangGraph's [memory docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/memory) draw the line by "recall scope." Short-term memory is saved as agent state through a checkpointer. Long-term memory "is shared *across* conversational threads" and saved in custom namespaces, so it "can be recalled *at any time* and *in any thread*."

The CoALA paper ([Sumers et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427)) uses the cognitive-science version: one **working memory** for the current decision cycle, plus long-term **episodic**, **semantic** and **procedural** memory. It inherits this layout from the Soar cognitive architecture, which built on psychological theories of memory going back to Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) and Baddeley and Hitch's working memory model (1974).

## Short-term vs long-term memory side by side

| | Short-term memory | Long-term memory |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | One thread, session or task run | Across threads; per user, agent, team or app |
| Lifetime | Until the thread ends or is deleted | Until explicitly updated, expired or deleted |
| Where it lives | Agent state, rendered into the prompt | External store: vectors, graph, tables, files |
| Size limit | The model's context window | Storage; only a small slice is retrieved per call |
| What goes in | Everything in the current exchange | Extracted facts, events, lessons, rules |
| Write cost | Free (append to state) | An LLM extraction call per write, in most systems |
| Read cost | Every token is resent each call | One search per turn, fixed token budget |
| CoALA name | Working memory | Episodic, semantic, procedural memory |
| LangGraph primitive | Checkpointer + `thread_id` | Store + namespace |
| Typical failure | Overflow, lost-in-the-middle, rising cost | Missed recall, stale facts, leaks between users |

The table hides one important asymmetry. Short-term memory is **lossless but small**: the model sees exactly what was said. Long-term memory is **large but lossy**: something decided what to keep, and retrieval decides what comes back. Most memory bugs live in that gap.

## How the two work together

A memory-enabled agent turn usually runs this loop:

1. **Load the thread.** Restore short-term state (messages, plan) from the checkpointer.
2. **Recall.** Search long-term memory with the new message and copy the top results into the prompt.
3. **Act.** Call the model and tools; append results to short-term state.
4. **Manage the window.** Trim, summarize or offload short-term history if it's getting large.
5. **Promote.** Extract anything worth keeping (a new preference, a decision, a lesson) and write it to long-term memory.
6. **Consolidate later.** A background job merges duplicates, resolves conflicts and expires stale items.

Step 5 has two timing options in LangGraph's terms. **Hot path** writes happen during the turn, often as a tool call; they're immediately available but add latency. **Background** writes happen after the turn; they add no latency but lag slightly. LangMem calls these "conscious" and "subconscious" memory formation. Step 6 is covered in [memory consolidation in AI agents](/articles/memory-consolidation-ai-agents/).

## One LangGraph agent with both memories

The pattern below uses a checkpointer for short-term memory and a store for long-term memory. It's adapted from LangGraph's [add-memory guide](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory):

```python
import uuid
from dataclasses import dataclass

from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langchain.embeddings import init_embeddings
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import START, MessagesState, StateGraph
from langgraph.runtime import Runtime
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

model = init_chat_model("anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5")
store = InMemoryStore(
    index={"embed": init_embeddings("openai:text-embedding-3-small"), "dims": 1536}
)

@dataclass
class Context:
    user_id: str

def call_model(state: MessagesState, runtime: Runtime[Context]):
    namespace = (runtime.context.user_id, "memories")
    last = state["messages"][-1].content

    # Long-term -> short-term: pull relevant memories into this turn's prompt
    hits = runtime.store.search(namespace, query=last, limit=3)
    known = "\n".join(h.value["text"] for h in hits)
    system = {"role": "system", "content": f"Known about the user:\n{known}"}
    response = model.invoke([system, *state["messages"]])

    # Short-term -> long-term: naive promotion; real systems extract facts with an LLM
    if "remember" in last.lower():
        runtime.store.put(namespace, str(uuid.uuid4()), {"text": last})
    return {"messages": [response]}

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState, context_schema=Context)
builder.add_node(call_model)
builder.add_edge(START, "call_model")
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=InMemorySaver(), store=store)

ctx = Context(user_id="user-1")
graph.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Remember: I'm vegetarian."}]},
    {"configurable": {"thread_id": "thread-1"}},
    context=ctx,
)
# New thread: short-term memory starts empty, long-term memory still has the fact
out = graph.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Suggest a dinner recipe."}]},
    {"configurable": {"thread_id": "thread-2"}},
    context=ctx,
)
print(out["messages"][-1].content)
```

The `thread_id` scopes short-term memory. The namespace `(user_id, "memories")` scopes long-term memory. Swap `InMemorySaver` and `InMemoryStore` for Postgres-backed versions in production, and replace the keyword check with an LLM extractor such as LangMem's `create_memory_store_manager`. A full walkthrough is in [how to give AI agents memory](/articles/how-to-give-ai-agents-memory/).

## What belongs in which memory

| Information | Short-term | Long-term | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| The last few messages | Yes | No | Needed verbatim now; little value later |
| A large tool output (web page, log) | Reference only | No | Offload to a file; keep the path |
| The current plan or to-do list | Yes | Sometimes | Save it only if the task spans sessions |
| "I'm vegetarian" | Yes | Yes | Durable preference |
| "I'm on a train right now" | Yes | No, or with expiry | Temporary state |
| What was decided in this meeting | Yes | Yes, as an episode | Users will ask "what did we decide?" |
| A lesson from a failed attempt | Yes | Yes | Prevents repeating the mistake |
| A change to the agent's own rules | No | Yes, with review | Procedural memory; affects every future task |

A quick test: if the user would be annoyed to repeat it next week, promote it. If it would be wrong or creepy to bring up next week, don't.

## Common mistakes

- **Treating a long context as long-term memory.** A bigger window still resets per session and costs more per call. [LongMemEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813) (Wu et al., 2024) found commercial chat assistants and long-context LLMs showed "a 30% accuracy drop" on memorizing information across sustained interactions.
- **Promoting everything.** Saving every message as a memory recreates the long-context problem inside your database, with worse ordering.
- **Never consolidating.** Without updates, both "lives in NYC" and "moved to SF" stay in the store forever.
- **Weak scoping.** Short-term memory is isolated by thread; long-term memory is only as isolated as your namespaces. Use a user or tenant ID in every key and test deletion.
- **No time on long-term items.** Store timestamps on everything you promote, so the agent can tell old facts from new ones.
