faq:
- question: "What is memory consolidation in AI agents?"
  answer: "It's the process that turns raw records of what an agent saw into fewer, cleaner, longer-lived memories. A consolidation step merges duplicates, resolves conflicting facts, and writes higher-level summaries or insights, usually with an LLM and often as a background job."
- question: "How is consolidation different from summarization?"
  answer: "Summarization shortens one piece of text, such as a conversation. Consolidation works across the whole memory store: it compares new information with what is already stored, then merges, updates, invalidates or abstracts it. Summaries are one possible output of consolidation."
- question: "When should an agent consolidate its memory?"
  answer: "Most systems do it in the background so users don't wait. Common triggers are a threshold of new important events (Generative Agents used a sum of importance scores above 150), context pressure (MemGPT warned at about 70% of the window), a set number of agent steps, or a schedule."

**Memory consolidation in AI agents** is the step that turns raw records (messages, tool results, observations) into a smaller set of cleaner, longer-lived memories. It merges duplicates, resolves contradictions, and writes higher-level insights. Without it, an agent's memory store only grows, and retrieval gets noisier with every session.

The term borrows from neuroscience, where consolidation means stabilizing new memories over time. In agents it's an engineering job, usually done by an LLM in a background process. This page covers the main techniques, when to run them, what goes wrong, and how current systems handle it.

## What is memory consolidation in AI agents?

**Memory consolidation is a write-side process that compares new information with what an agent already remembers, then merges, updates, invalidates or abstracts it so the store stays accurate and compact.** It runs after information is captured and before it's needed again. Its output is fewer, higher-quality memories with links back to their sources.

It helps to separate three jobs that often get blurred:

- **Capture:** saving what happened (a message log, an extracted fact).
- **Consolidation:** reorganizing what was captured across many records.
- **Forgetting:** lowering the weight of, or removing, what no longer matters. That's covered in [AI memory decay](/articles/ai-memory-decay/).

Consolidation is part of the write path in the general [AI agent memory architecture](/articles/ai-agent-memory-explained/). It's also where most of the quality difference between memory systems comes from, because a wrong merge gets injected into every later prompt.

## Why agents need consolidation

An append-only store fails in predictable ways.

**Duplicates crowd out useful results.** If a user mentions their dietary preference in ten sessions, a vector search for "food" returns ten near-identical records and fills the retrieval budget.

**Facts change.** "I live in NYC" in January and "I moved to SF" in June can both match a query. The [LongMemEval benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813) (Wu et al., ICLR 2025) treats this as its own ability, **knowledge updates**, alongside multi-session and temporal reasoning. Its authors report that commercial assistants and long-context LLMs show a 30% accuracy drop on memory across sustained interactions.

**Raw observations don't answer abstract questions.** In the [Generative Agents paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) (Park et al., UIST 2023), an agent with only observational memory picked the person it interacted with most often as the one it would spend an hour with. It needed a higher-level conclusion ("Klaus is passionate about research") to answer well. The paper's ablation found that removing reflection lowered believability.

## Memory consolidation techniques

Published systems use six main patterns. Most production systems combine two or three.

| Technique | What it does | Where it comes from | Main risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reflection | Writes new, more abstract memories from recent ones, with citations | Generative Agents (2023) | Confident but wrong insights |
| Hierarchical summaries | Rolls conversations into daily, then global summaries | MemoryBank (2023), RAPTOR (2024) | Detail lost at each level |
| Extract and reconcile | Compares each new fact with similar stored facts, then adds, updates or deletes | Mem0 paper (2025) | Bad merges overwrite good data |
| Invalidate, don't delete | Marks old facts as no longer valid, keeps history | Graphiti / Zep (2025) | Larger graph, more complex queries |
| Note evolution | Links new memories to old ones and rewrites old notes' context | A-Mem (2025) | Drift in old memories |
| Background "sleep-time" passes | Runs consolidation between user turns | Letta (2025), LangMem | Memory lags behind the conversation |

### Reflection

Generative Agents introduced **reflection**: periodically asking the model what it can conclude from recent memories. The paper's recipe is specific:

1. Trigger when the sum of importance scores of recent events passes **150**. Its agents reflected "roughly two or three times a day."
2. Feed the **100 most recent** memories and ask for the "3 most salient high-level questions."
3. Retrieve memories for each question.
4. Ask for "5 high-level insights" with the numbers of the records that support each one.
5. Store each insight as a new memory, with pointers to the cited records.

Reflections can cite other reflections, so the store becomes a tree: raw observations at the leaves, abstract beliefs higher up. Reflections are retrieved alongside observations, using the same scoring.

### Hierarchical summaries

**MemoryBank** ([Zhong et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10250)) condenses each day's dialogue into a daily event summary, then merges those into a global summary of the user's history and personality. **RAPTOR** ([Sarthi et al., ICLR 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18059)) does the same for documents: it clusters chunks, summarizes each cluster, and repeats, building a tree that can be searched at any level. More on tree and tier structures in [hierarchical memory for LLMs](/articles/llm-hierarchical-memory/).

### Extract and reconcile

The [Mem0 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19413) (Chhikara et al., 2025) describes a two-phase pipeline. An extraction phase pulls candidate facts from new messages. An update phase compares each fact with the most similar stored memories and has the LLM choose one of four operations: **ADD**, **UPDATE**, **DELETE** or **NOOP**.

Mem0 has since moved away from this. Its [v3 migration guide](https://docs.mem0.ai/migration/oss-v2-to-v3) describes the new extraction as "Single-pass ADD-only (one LLM call, no UPDATE/DELETE)." When information changes, the new fact is stored next to the old one, and retrieval ranks current information first. That shifts conflict handling from write time to read time.

### Invalidate instead of delete

Graphiti, the engine inside Zep, keeps every fact with two timelines: when it was true in the world, and when the system learned or retired it. The [Zep paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956) (Rasmussen et al., 2025) explains that an LLM compares each new relationship with related existing ones. If they conflict and overlap in time, the old edge gets its `t_invalid` set to the new edge's `t_valid`. Nothing is deleted, so you can still ask what was true in March. Raw inputs stay in an episode subgraph as "a non-lossy data store." See [knowledge graphs for AI memory](/articles/ai-memory-knowledge-graph/) for how that graph is built.

### Note evolution

**A-Mem** ([Xu et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110)) applies the Zettelkasten method. Each new memory becomes a note with keywords, tags and a context description. The system links it to related notes, and new notes "can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories." Old memories keep getting rewritten as understanding improves.

### Background and sleep-time consolidation

Running consolidation inside a user's turn adds latency. Most current systems move it to the background:

- **Letta** calls this **sleep-time compute** ([Lin et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13171)), now branded "dreaming" in Letta Code. Background subagents "review recent conversations, consolidate useful lessons, and update memory." The paper reports about 5x less test-time compute for the same accuracy on its stateful math benchmarks. Details are in the [Letta guide](/articles/letta-ai-guide/).
- **LangMem** ships a "background memory manager that automatically extracts, consolidates, and updates agent knowledge." The default prompt of its `create_memory_store_manager` tells the model to "Consolidate and compress redundant memories." Deletes are off by default (`enable_deletes=False`).
- **Hindsight** ([GitHub](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight)) runs background consolidation that turns related facts into **observations**, which its README calls "deduplicated beliefs the bank has built up over time." Each observation keeps its supporting evidence and is "refined rather than overwritten" when new evidence arrives.
- **MemoryOS** promotes mid-term memory segments into long-term persona memory when a "heat" score passes 5. The MemoryOS paper covers the details.

## When to run consolidation

The trigger matters as much as the method. Here are the triggers used in published systems:

| Trigger | Example | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| Importance threshold | Generative Agents: sum of importance scores above 150 | Event-heavy agents, simulations |
| Context pressure | MemGPT: "memory pressure" warning at about 70% of the window, flush at 100% | Long single sessions |
| Step count or compaction | Letta dreaming: after a set number of steps, or when context is compacted | Coding and task agents |
| Popularity score | MemoryOS: heat above 5 | Chat assistants with recurring topics |
| Every write | Mem0 extraction runs on each `add()` call | Simple personalization |
| Schedule | Nightly batch over the day's sessions | High-volume apps where cost matters |

The MemGPT numbers come from the [MemGPT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560) (Packer et al., 2023), which gives 70% and 100% as example thresholds, not fixed rules.

## A minimal reflection loop in Python

This sketch follows the Generative Agents recipe: rate each memory's importance on write, and reflect when the running total passes 150. It uses the OpenAI Responses API; any chat model works.

```python
import json
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
REFLECT_AT = 150  # sum of importance scores, from Park et al. (2023)


def ask(prompt: str) -> str:
    return client.responses.create(model="gpt-5-mini", input=prompt).output_text


class MemoryStream:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.items: list[dict] = []
        self.pending = 0  # importance added since the last reflection

    def add(self, text: str, kind: str = "observation", cites: list[int] | None = None) -> None:
        reply = ask(
            "On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is mundane and 10 is extremely poignant, "
            f"rate this memory. Reply with one integer.\nMemory: {text}"
        )
        importance = int(reply.strip()) if reply.strip().isdigit() else 3
        self.items.append({"id": len(self.items), "text": text, "kind": kind,
                           "importance": importance, "cites": cites or []})
        if kind == "observation":
            self.pending += importance
            if self.pending >= REFLECT_AT:
                self.reflect()

    def reflect(self) -> None:
        self.pending = 0
        recent = self.items[-100:]
        numbered = "\n".join(f"{m['id']}. {m['text']}" for m in recent)
        reply = ask(
            f"Statements:\n{numbered}\n\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer? "
            'Return JSON: [{"insight": "...", "because": [ids]}]'
        )
        for row in json.loads(reply):
            self.add(row["insight"], kind="reflection", cites=row["because"])
```

Two choices here come straight from the paper and are worth keeping. Reflections are stored as ordinary memories, so retrieval treats them the same way. And each reflection keeps the IDs of its evidence, so you can audit or undo it later. A production version would also retrieve evidence per question instead of using only the last 100 items.

## What goes wrong with consolidation

Consolidation is a lossy, LLM-driven rewrite of your data. These are the failure modes to plan for.

**Hallucinated insights.** A reflection can state something no record supports. Keeping citations (as Generative Agents and Hindsight do) lets you check and drop unsupported ones.

**Destructive updates.** An UPDATE or DELETE based on a misread message removes correct data for good. That risk is one reason Graphiti invalidates instead of deleting, and why Mem0 v3 switched to ADD-only. If your system overwrites, keep the raw source.

**Compounding drift.** Summaries of summaries lose detail at each level. Reflections built on reflections can move far from what was actually said. Keep raw episodes as the ground truth and rebuild derived layers when needed.

**Lag.** Background consolidation means the newest facts may not be merged yet when the next question arrives. Retrieval should search raw recent memories as well as consolidated ones.

**Cost.** Every consolidation pass is LLM calls. Batch work, trigger on thresholds rather than every message, and use a smaller model for rating and extraction.

## How to add consolidation to an agent

1. **Keep raw records.** Store messages or episodes untouched, with timestamps. Everything else is derived.
2. **Pick the unit you consolidate.** Facts about a user, events, or lessons from tasks. Each needs a different prompt.
3. **Choose a conflict policy.** Overwrite, keep both and rank by time, or invalidate with validity windows. Write it down.
4. **Set a trigger.** An importance threshold, a step count, or a nightly job. Avoid running on every message unless volume is low.
5. **Store provenance.** Each consolidated memory should point to the records it came from.
6. **Search both layers.** Retrieve consolidated memories for breadth and recent raw ones for freshness.
7. **Test changed facts.** Build a few cases where a user changes a preference, then check which version the agent uses. The knowledge-update questions in LongMemEval are a good template.
