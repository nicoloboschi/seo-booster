faq:
- question: "What is Memori by GibsonAI?"
  answer: "Memori is an open-source (Apache 2.0) memory layer for LLM agents that was first released in 2025 under GibsonAI, a database company, as a 'SQL-native' memory engine. It is now developed by Memori Labs. It wraps your LLM client, records conversations, extracts structured memories, and recalls them automatically on later calls."
- question: "Where does Memori store agent memory?"
  answer: "Either in Memori Cloud or in your own database (BYODB). BYODB supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, CockroachDB, TiDB, OceanBase, Oracle and MongoDB, plus managed services built on them. Memories land in tables such as memori_entity_fact and memori_knowledge_graph."
- question: "Is Memori the same as memorisdk?"
  answer: "memorisdk was the original PyPI package name under GibsonAI, with a 'conscious' and 'auto' memory mode. The current package is memori (version 3.3.6 in May 2026) with a different API built around registering your LLM client and setting entity and process attribution."

**Memori** is an open-source memory layer for AI agents that stores memory in **ordinary SQL databases** rather than a dedicated vector store. It started in 2025 as a GibsonAI project billed as a "SQL-native memory engine," and is now developed by **Memori Labs**. You wrap your LLM client with Memori, and it records conversations, extracts facts and relationships, and injects relevant memories into later calls automatically.

This page explains where Memori came from, how it stores and recalls memory today, how to set it up in Python with your own database, and how to read its benchmark claims. Sources are the [Memori GitHub repo](https://github.com/MemoriLabs/Memori), the [Memori docs](https://memorilabs.ai/docs/) and the [Memori paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.19935), checked on 8 October 2026.

## What is Memori?

**Memori is an LLM-, database- and framework-agnostic memory layer. It intercepts calls made through a registered LLM client, stores the conversation, runs background "Advanced Augmentation" to extract facts, preferences, relationships and rules, and recalls matching memories into future prompts. Memories can live in Memori Cloud or in your own SQL database.**

The core idea is that agent memory is a **data structuring problem**. The Memori paper argues that compact, structured records (semantic triples plus conversation summaries) beat bigger context windows on both accuracy and cost.

The repository is Apache 2.0, written in Python with a Rust core, and had about 17,000 GitHub stars in October 2026.

## From GibsonAI to Memori Labs

The history explains why search results mix the two names.

- **2025, GibsonAI.** The repo was created in July 2025 under GibsonAI, a company building AI-managed databases. Its early README called Memori an "Open-Source Memory Engine for LLMs, AI Agents & Multi-Agent Systems," installed with `pip install memorisdk`. It offered **dual-mode memory**: "conscious" short-term memory promoted into context, and "auto" mode that searched the database per query. Storage was SQLite, PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **2026, Memori Labs.** The project moved to the `MemoriLabs/Memori` repo (the old GibsonAI URL redirects). Memori Labs launched **Memori Cloud**, a hosted version, in March 2026, per [Open Source For You](https://www.opensourceforu.com/2026/03/open-source-memory-engine-from-memori-labs-goes-fully-hosted-with-memori-cloud/), with deployment options for cloud, BYODB, VPC and on-prem. The company's CEO is Adam B. Struck and its CTO is Michael Montero, both authors of the Memori paper.

The current package is `memori` on PyPI (3.3.6, May 2026) and `@memorilabs/memori` on npm. Code written for `memorisdk`, including `conscious_ingest=True` and `memori.enable()`, doesn't match the current API.

## How Memori stores and recalls memory

### Attribution: entity, process, session

Memori tracks memory at three levels, and it **won't create memories without attribution**:

| Level | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Entity** | A person, place or thing | `user_123` |
| **Process** | Your agent, program or LLM workflow | `support_agent` |
| **Session** | One run of interactions between them | Set automatically, or with `set_session()` |

### Advanced Augmentation

After each LLM call returns, Memori queues the conversation for **Advanced Augmentation** in the background, so the response isn't delayed. Per the [augmentation docs](https://github.com/MemoriLabs/Memori/blob/main/docs/memori-byodb/concepts/advanced-augmentation.mdx), it:

1. reads the user messages and AI responses;
2. identifies facts, preferences, skills, attributes and events;
3. extracts semantic triples (subject, predicate, object);
4. generates embeddings for semantic search;
5. stores the results.

It also captures **agent execution traces**, such as tool calls, decisions and outcomes, which is what the README means by "memory from what agents do, not just what they say."

One detail matters for privacy. By default (Memori 3.3.6), the Python SDK's BYODB mode still sends conversations to Memori's hosted augmentation API and writes the results to your database. The README says augmentation works without an account but is rate-limited per IP address, and an API key raises the limits. So BYODB keeps the **stored** memory in your database; it doesn't keep extraction off Memori's servers.

### Recall

When a new call goes through the wrapped client, Memori searches stored entity facts for the query, ranks candidates by vector similarity (the docs mention FAISS), and adds the matches to the prompt. Agents running under OpenClaw or Hermes also get explicit recall tools, such as `memori_recall` and `memori_recall_summary`.

### What the tables look like

In BYODB mode, Memori creates its own tables in your database, including `memori_conversation_message` (raw messages), `memori_entity_fact` (extracted facts used for recall), `memori_process_attribute` and `memori_knowledge_graph`. Because it's plain SQL, you can query, back up and audit memory with tools you already run. For the tradeoffs of SQL versus vector stores, see [vector databases for LLM memory](/articles/vector-database-for-llm-memory/).

## Setting up Memori in Python with your own database

This follows the BYODB quickstart and matches `memori` 3.3.6:

```python
import sqlite3
from memori import Memori
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()  # needs OPENAI_API_KEY

mem = Memori(conn=lambda: sqlite3.connect("memori.db")).llm.register(client)
mem.config.storage.build()  # create Memori's tables
mem.attribution(entity_id="user_123", process_id="support_agent")

client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "My favorite color is blue."}],
)
mem.augmentation.wait()  # short scripts: let background extraction finish

reply = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's my favorite color?"}],
)
print(reply.choices[0].message.content)  # Memori injects the stored fact
```

Swap the connection factory for PostgreSQL, MySQL or another supported engine. For Memori Cloud, drop `conn` and set `MEMORI_API_KEY`.

Supported pieces, per the README and docs:

- **LLMs:** OpenAI (Chat Completions and Responses), Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, DeepSeek and xAI Grok; streamed and unstreamed, sync and async.
- **Frameworks:** Agno, LangChain and Pydantic AI.
- **Databases (BYODB):** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, CockroachDB, TiDB, OceanBase, Oracle and MongoDB, plus managed services such as AWS RDS, Neon and Supabase.
- **Agents and tools:** an OpenClaw plugin, a Hermes Agent memory provider, and an MCP server for Claude Code, Cursor and Codex.

## Memori benchmark claims

Memori reports results on [LoCoMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17753), and two sources give different numbers:

- The **README** reports **87% overall accuracy** at an average of **721 tokens per query**, which it calls 2.8% of the full-context footprint.
- The **paper** ([arXiv 2603.19935](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.19935), March 2026) reports **81.95% accuracy** at **1,294 tokens per query**, about 5% of full context, with 67% fewer tokens than competing approaches.

The gap likely reflects different versions or setups, but neither source explains it. Both are **self-reported** by Memori Labs, and both claim to beat Zep, LangMem and Mem0. Other vendors claim LoCoMo scores in the high 80s to 90s under their own setups, so treat these as claims to test. Our [LLM memory comparison](/articles/llm-memory-comparison/) lists them side by side.

## When Memori fits

Memori fits teams that want agent memory in **infrastructure they already run**: an existing Postgres or MySQL, with memories they can inspect with SQL. The client-wrapping approach means almost no code changes, and attribution by entity and process maps well onto multi-user, multi-agent apps.

It fits less well if conversations must never leave your network, since default BYODB extraction still goes through Memori's API in the Python SDK, or if you want to control the extraction step yourself. Fully self-run alternatives include Mem0's Docker server, Graphiti and [Hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight); see [open-source memory systems compared](/articles/open-source-memory-systems-compared/).
