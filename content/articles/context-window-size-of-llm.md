faq:
- question: What is the context window size of an LLM?
 answer: The context window size of an LLM refers to the maximum amount of text, measured in tokens, that the model can process and consider at any one time during inference. This limit dictates how much
 information the AI can "remember" from its input history.
- question: Why does context window size of LLM matter for AI agents?
 answer: Understanding context window size of LLM is essential for building production AI systems that maintain context, learn from interactions, and provide reliable results. A larger context window allows
 AI agents to retain and recall more information, leading to better understanding and more coherent responses.
- question: What are the limitations of early LLM context windows like BERT and GPT-2?
 answer: Early LLMs had significantly smaller context windows. For instance, BERT typically had a **BERT context window size of 512 tokens**, and GPT-2 offered a **GPT-2 context window of 1024 tokens**.
 These limitations restricted their ability to process longer texts or maintain extended conversations, often leading to a loss of information from earlier parts of the input.
- question: How does context window size affect LLM performance?
 answer: A larger context window enables LLMs to handle longer documents, maintain more complex dialogues, and perform tasks requiring recall of extensive information. However, it can also increase computational
 costs and introduce challenges with positional encoding for very long sequences.
- question: What is the primary limitation imposed by an LLM's context window size?
 answer: The primary limitation is that an LLM can only process and "remember" a fixed amount of text (tokens) at any given time. Once this **context window limit** is full, older information is discarded,
 preventing the model from recalling earlier parts of a conversation or document. This is a key aspect of **AI memory limits in large language models**.
- question: How do larger context windows benefit AI agents?
 answer: Larger context windows allow AI agents to maintain a more extensive understanding of ongoing interactions, recall more details from previous turns, and process longer documents without losing
 crucial information. This leads to more coherent, contextually relevant, and capable AI behavior, directly impacting **AI memory**.
- question: Are there ways to overcome the fixed context window limitation of LLMs?
 answer: Yes, techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), memory consolidation, and the use of external memory modules allow AI systems to access and use information beyond their inherent context
 window, effectively extending their memory capabilities.
- question: What are AI memory limits in large language models?
 answer: AI memory limits in large language models refer to the constraints imposed by the LLM's context window size. This means the model can only process and recall a finite amount of information at
 any given time. Once the **context window limit** is reached, older information is typically discarded, impacting the AI's ability to maintain long-term context or recall distant details from a conversation
 or document.
