faq:
- question: "What is the main memory difference between OpenClaw and Hermes Agent?"
  answer: "Hermes keeps a tiny, hard-capped memory (2,200 + 1,375 characters) that loads as a frozen snapshot each session, and searches old sessions with full-text search. OpenClaw keeps open-ended Markdown files with daily notes, indexed for hybrid vector and keyword search, and promotes notes into MEMORY.md with a background dreaming job."
- question: "Can I move my memory from OpenClaw to Hermes or back?"
  answer: "Yes. hermes claw migrate imports OpenClaw's SOUL.md, memories, skills and AGENTS.md, with a dry-run preview. In the other direction, OpenClaw's Settings, Import Memory copies Hermes's MEMORY.md and USER.md into memory/imports/hermes/ as searchable notes."
- question: "Do OpenClaw and Hermes support Mem0, Honcho or Hindsight?"
  answer: "Both do through plugins. Hermes lists nine external providers, including Honcho, Mem0, Hindsight and Supermemory, with one active at a time. OpenClaw ships Honcho and LanceDB engines, and Mem0 and Hindsight publish their own OpenClaw plugins."

**OpenClaw vs Hermes Agent memory** comes down to two philosophies. **Hermes** keeps memory tiny and fixed: two hard-capped files loaded as a frozen snapshot, plus full-text search over old sessions. **OpenClaw** keeps memory open-ended: Markdown files and daily notes, indexed for hybrid search, with a background job that promotes the best notes into `MEMORY.md`.

Both are open-source (MIT) agents that run on your machine and chat through messaging apps. [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) comes from Peter Steinberger and the OpenClaw Foundation; [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) comes from Nous Research. Facts below come from each project's docs, checked October 2026.

## What is the difference between OpenClaw and Hermes memory?

**Both agents store memory as plain text the agent writes itself. Hermes bounds it hard, about 1,300 tokens always in context, and treats everything else as searchable history. OpenClaw lets memory grow as files, loads only the curated ones at start, and retrieves the rest by semantic and keyword search.**

Neither is "better." Hermes's approach keeps prompts small and the prompt cache stable. OpenClaw's approach holds more and retrieves it, at the cost of an embedding provider and an index. Both sit at the simple end of the spectrum described in [AI agent memory explained](/articles/ai-agent-memory-explained/).

## Side-by-side comparison

| | Hermes Agent | OpenClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **Always-loaded files** | `MEMORY.md` (agent notes), `USER.md` (profile) | `MEMORY.md` (durable facts), `USER.md` (optional profile) |
| **Location** | `~/.hermes/memories/` | Agent workspace, default `~/.openclaw/workspace` |
| **Size limits** | 2,200 and 1,375 characters, enforced by the tool | Bootstrap budget; over it, the injected copy is truncated |
| **Mid-session updates** | Saved to disk; prompt updates next session (frozen snapshot) | Files on disk; search sees new notes once indexed |
| **Daily or episodic notes** | None; full sessions in SQLite | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` daily notes |
| **Search** | `session_search`: SQLite FTS5 over past sessions | `memory_search`: hybrid vector + BM25, recency decay, MMR |
| **Embeddings needed** | No | Optional (default OpenAI; local GGUF possible) |
| **Write tool** | `memory` tool: add, replace, remove | Agent writes Markdown files; `memory_get` reads |
| **Consolidation** | Agent must consolidate when full; background review | Dreaming job promotes notes into `MEMORY.md`; flush before compaction |
| **Write approval** | `memory.write_approval: true` stages writes | Dreaming output goes to `DREAMS.md` for review |
| **Safety scan** | Entries scanned for injection, exfiltration, invisible Unicode | Untrusted candidates excluded from promotion |
| **External providers** | One at a time: Honcho, OpenViking, Mem0, Hindsight, Holographic, RetainDB, ByteRover, Supermemory, Memori | Builtin, Honcho, LanceDB engines; Memory Wiki; third-party plugins (Mem0, Hindsight) |

## How Hermes handles memory

Hermes keeps the always-on part small. The agent adds, replaces or removes short entries through a memory tool, and a write that would overflow returns an error so the agent has to consolidate first. The [Hermes docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/memory) explain the frozen snapshot: it "preserves the LLM's prefix cache," so the system prompt doesn't change mid-session and cached tokens stay cheap.

Anything bigger goes to session history. Every CLI and messaging session lands in `~/.hermes/state.db`, and `session_search` finds raw messages with full-text search. No embeddings, no extraction model. Skills carry procedures the agent learned. The full breakdown is on [Hermes Agent memory](/articles/hermes-agent-memory/).

## How OpenClaw handles memory

OpenClaw writes more and retrieves more. Daily notes capture running context. `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` load at start. Everything is indexed in SQLite, and `memory_search` merges vector similarity with BM25, multiplies by a 30-day half-life recency decay and an importance score, and drops near-duplicates with MMR.

Two background steps keep it tidy: a **memory flush** before compaction asks the agent to save what matters, and **dreaming** promotes short-term notes that pass score, frequency and diversity checks into `MEMORY.md`. The full breakdown is on [OpenClaw AI agent memory](/articles/openclaw-ai-agent-memory/).

## Which one remembers better?

There's no published head-to-head benchmark of the two built-in systems, so any claim that one "remembers better" is opinion. What the designs predict:

- **Exact recent facts in the prompt**: about even. Both load a curated file at start.
- **Something said three weeks ago, worded differently**: OpenClaw has the edge, since vector search matches meaning and Hermes's FTS5 matches words.
- **Exact identifiers and error strings**: both do fine; FTS5 and BM25 both match exact tokens.
- **Token cost per turn**: Hermes is lower and more predictable, by design.
- **Seeing a fact you added mid-session**: Hermes shows it in tool responses right away, but not in the system prompt until `/new`.

If you outgrow either, both accept an external provider. Picking one is the same decision as picking any memory layer; [the LLM memory comparison](/articles/llm-memory-comparison/) covers Mem0, Honcho, Hindsight, Supermemory and others.

## Migrating between them

The two projects make switching easy:

1. **OpenClaw to Hermes**: run `hermes claw migrate`. It imports `SOUL.md`, memories, user-created skills, command allowlists, messaging settings, allowlisted API keys and `AGENTS.md`. The setup wizard also detects `~/.openclaw` and offers this, with a dry-run preview.
2. **Hermes to OpenClaw**: in the OpenClaw Control UI, open **Settings → Import Memory**. It copies Hermes's `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` into `memory/imports/hermes/`, searchable but not merged into OpenClaw's own `MEMORY.md`.

After a move, review what came across. A 2,200-character Hermes store maps cleanly into OpenClaw, but OpenClaw daily notes won't fit Hermes's caps; they'll need trimming into a few durable entries.

## How to choose

Choose **Hermes** if you want memory you can read in a minute, predictable token use, and a strong built-in skill system. Choose **OpenClaw** if you want the agent to keep a growing journal and find old notes by meaning, and you're fine running an embedding provider (or a local model). In both, memory is guidance, not enforcement; OpenClaw's docs say so outright. For hard rules, use each agent's approval and sandbox settings. And because both agents read content from chats and the web into memory, read up on [memory injection attacks](/articles/ai-memory-injection/) before giving either access to untrusted inputs.
