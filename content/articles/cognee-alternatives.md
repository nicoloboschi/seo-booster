faq:
  - question: "Is Cognee open source and free?"
    answer: "Yes. Cognee is Apache 2.0 and free to self-host, and since v1.6 it can build and search text memory with local models and no LLM API key. Cognee Cloud has a free tier with 1M tokens, then $1 per 1M tokens processed; Enterprise is custom (pricing as of October 2026)."
  - question: "What is the closest alternative to Cognee?"
    answer: "Graphiti is the closest in design: an Apache 2.0 framework that builds a temporal knowledge graph for agents. It focuses on facts that change over time, while Cognee focuses on turning documents, code and conversations into a searchable graph."
  - question: "Can I migrate from Mem0, Zep or Letta to Cognee, or back?"
    answer: "Cognee documents importing memory from Mem0, Letta, Zep and Graphiti using its COGX exchange format. Going the other way, each target system has its own ingestion API, so you would export from Cognee and re-ingest."

**Cognee alternatives** are other memory systems for AI agents: Mem0, Graphiti, Zep, Letta, Hindsight and Supermemory. People look for one when Cognee's knowledge-graph pipeline is more than they need for simple per-user memory, when they want temporal fact tracking in open source, or when they want the agent itself to manage memory.

Below: what Cognee does, a comparison table, a short section per alternative, and how to choose. Facts come from each project's README, docs and pricing page, checked in October 2026.

## What Cognee does, and why people look for Cognee alternatives

**Cognee is an open-source (Apache 2.0) memory engine that turns documents, code and conversations into a knowledge graph plus vector index that agents can search. Text becomes entities, relationships and chunks; code becomes a graph of symbols and dependencies.** You use it through four operations: `remember`, `recall`, `improve` and `forget`.

From the [Cognee README](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee):

- It stores data in three layers: relational (documents and provenance), vector (embeddings) and graph (entities and relationships).
- Since v1.6 (September 2026) it can extract a graph with the local GLiNER model and embed with a local model, so it runs **without an LLM key**. Add a key to get generated answers.
- It ships plugins for Claude Code, Codex and OpenClaw, an MCP server, and SDKs for Python, TypeScript and Rust.
- The research behind it is [Markovic et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24478), on optimizing the interface between knowledge graphs and LLMs.

Cognee is a good fit for a "company brain" over docs, tickets and code. The common reasons people compare it with others:

1. **The job is per-user chat memory.** A graph pipeline is more machinery than storing "Dana prefers short answers."
2. **Some production pieces are licensed.** The README calls Postgres-as-graph-store "a demo feature," with the production version "available as a licensed product," and says the bundled GLiNER extractor is a demo of the small-model pipeline.
3. **Temporal memory is an Enterprise item.** Cognee's [pricing page](https://www.cognee.ai/pricing) lists "bi-temporal memory with conflict resolution" under Enterprise.
4. **They want an agent runtime**, not a memory layer.

Prices are published list prices and change often.

## Mem0

**Mem0** is a memory layer focused on personalization. It extracts facts from conversations with one LLM call per add, stores them for user, session and agent scopes, and retrieves them with semantic, BM25 and entity matching fused together. It runs as a library, a self-hosted server, or the managed Platform.

Note the graph difference. Mem0's [v3 migration guide](https://docs.mem0.ai/migration/oss-v2-to-v3) says graph memory "is removed from the open-source SDK" and now lives on the hosted Platform's Pro plan.

- **Pick Mem0** for simple user memory with a small API and many framework integrations.
- **Look elsewhere** if you need an open-source knowledge graph over documents. That's Cognee's ground.

The head-to-head is in [Mem0 vs Cognee](/articles/mem0-vs-cognee/), and the wider field in our [Mem0 alternatives comparison](/articles/mem0-alternatives-compared/).

## Graphiti

**[Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti)** is Zep's open-source framework for temporal context graphs. Entities are nodes, facts are edges with validity windows, and every fact traces back to the raw "episode" it came from. When a fact changes, the old one is invalidated, not deleted. Retrieval combines embeddings, BM25 and graph traversal.

Compared with Cognee, Graphiti is narrower and more time-focused. It's a library: you bring the graph database and build users, threads and tooling yourself. It defaults to OpenAI for extraction and embeddings.

- **Pick Graphiti** if fact history ("what was true before?") matters more than document ingestion.
- **Look elsewhere** if you don't want to run a graph database.

## Zep

**Zep** is the managed service on top of Graphiti's ideas. It builds a context graph per user, customer or account, adds users, threads and a dashboard, and claims sub-200 ms retrieval. Zep stopped maintaining its open-source Community Edition in April 2025, so self-hosting now means an Enterprise BYOC deal. Pricing is credit-based on ingestion: 1 credit per 350 bytes sent, with retrieval unmetered.

- **Pick Zep** if you want temporal graph memory as a managed service with SLAs.
- **Look elsewhere** if open source is the reason you chose Cognee.

Our [Zep alternatives guide](/articles/zep-alternatives/) covers this in more detail.

## Letta

**Letta** (formerly MemGPT) is the agent runtime, not a memory store you call. Letta Code agents keep memory as Markdown files in a git-backed filesystem (MemFS), search their message history, and run background "dreaming" to consolidate lessons. It's Apache 2.0.

- **Pick Letta** if you're building a long-lived agent and want it to own and rewrite its memory.
- **Look elsewhere** if you need a memory backend for an existing agent. Letta's Agent SDK is TypeScript only and its Python client is deprecated.

See the [Letta guide](/articles/letta-ai-guide/) for the full picture.

## Hindsight

**[Hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight)** is an MIT-licensed memory server. `retain` uses an LLM to extract facts, entities, relationships and time data. `recall` runs semantic, BM25, graph and time-range searches in parallel, then merges them with rank fusion and a cross-encoder reranker. `reflect` reasons over memories to answer open questions.

In the background it consolidates facts into **observations**, beliefs that keep their supporting quotes and get refined when new evidence arrives. Mental models are standing answers ("What are this user's preferences?") that Hindsight keeps up to date. It runs on PostgreSQL with pgvector, so entity links live there rather than in a separate graph database.

- **Pick Hindsight** if your memory is mostly what an agent learns from interactions over time, and you want it self-hosted under MIT.
- **Look elsewhere** if you need a graph over a large document and code corpus; Cognee is built for that. Every retain makes LLM calls, and the README says Hindsight "may be overkill" for simple workflow automations.

## Supermemory

**Supermemory** is a hosted memory and context API. It extracts facts, keeps user profiles, combines RAG over your files with personal memory in one query, and syncs from Google Drive, Gmail, Notion, OneDrive and GitHub. Its README lists multi-modal extractors for PDFs, images, video and code.

- **Pick Supermemory** if you want document RAG and user memory from one managed API, with little to run.
- **Look elsewhere** if fully self-run, open infrastructure is a requirement. A local server exists, but self-hosting is listed under the $399/month Scale plan.

## How to choose a Cognee alternative

Match the tool to what your memory is made of.

| Your memory is mostly... | Look at |
|---|---|
| Documents, tickets and code across a team | Cognee (stay), Supermemory |
| Per-user preferences in a chat app | Mem0, Supermemory |
| Facts that change, where history matters | Graphiti, Zep, Hindsight |
| Lessons an agent learns from its own work | Hindsight, Letta |
| An agent's own identity and skills | Letta |

Three checks before you switch:

1. **Do you need a graph database?** Graphiti does. Cognee ships local defaults and can swap in production backends. Hindsight and Mem0's server run on Postgres.
2. **Who calls the LLM, and how often?** Mem0, Graphiti and Hindsight extract with an LLM on every write. Cognee can use a local model.
3. **Can you move data later?** Cognee documents imports from Mem0, Letta, Zep and Graphiti. Check the export path of whatever you pick, too.
