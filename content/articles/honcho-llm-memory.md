faq:
- question: "What is Honcho?"
  answer: "Honcho is an open-source memory service for LLM agents from Plastic Labs. You store conversations as messages on sessions; Honcho reasons over them in the background and builds a representation of each participant (a peer), which you can query in natural language or pull as prompt-ready context."
- question: "Is Honcho open source?"
  answer: "Yes. The Honcho server is licensed AGPL-3.0 on GitHub (plastic-labs/honcho). You can self-host it with Docker Compose or run a local stack with the honcho CLI. Plastic Labs also runs a managed service at api.honcho.dev."
- question: "How is Honcho different from Mem0?"
  answer: "Mem0 extracts facts from messages and returns them by search. Honcho stores the messages themselves and runs background reasoning to derive conclusions about each peer, including what one peer knows about another, and answers natural-language questions about them through its chat endpoint. Mem0 is Apache 2.0; Honcho is AGPL-3.0."

**Honcho** is an open-source memory service for LLM agents, built by Plastic Labs. Instead of only storing extracted facts, it **reasons about the people and agents in your conversations**. You save messages; a background worker derives conclusions about each participant; then you ask Honcho what it knows, in plain language or as prompt-ready context.

This page covers Honcho's data model, how its reasoning pipeline works, the Python SDK, self-hosting, pricing and its benchmark claims. Sources are the [Honcho GitHub README](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho), the [Honcho docs](https://honcho.dev/docs/v3) and [honcho.dev](https://honcho.dev/), checked on 8 October 2026.

## What is Honcho?

**Honcho is memory infrastructure for stateful agents. It stores messages and events on sessions, reasons over them asynchronously, and maintains a representation of every participant, called a peer. Agents query those representations, search history, or ask natural-language questions such as "what learning style does this user respond to?"**

Its README describes it as memory for agents "that understand changing people, agents, groups, projects, and ideas over time." The server is a FastAPI app, licensed **AGPL-3.0**, at version 3.3.0 in October 2026. The Python SDK is `honcho-ai` (2.5.1) and the TypeScript SDK is `@honcho-ai/sdk`.

The emphasis is **user modeling** rather than retrieval. Most memory layers answer "which stored facts match this query?" Honcho also tries to answer "what kind of person is this, and what do they likely want?"

## Honcho's data model: workspaces, peers and sessions

| Concept | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Workspace** | Top-level container that isolates one app or use case (formerly "App") |
| **Peer** | Any participant, human or AI agent (formerly "User") |
| **Session** | A conversation; many-to-many with peers |
| **Scope** | A named group of sessions that limits what recall can see |
| **Message** | One unit of data: a chat turn, an event, or an ingested document chunk |

The **peer model** is Honcho's distinctive choice. Humans and agents are both first-class, sessions can have many of each, and you can configure which peers observe which. Internally, observations live in collections keyed by an `(observer, observed)` pair, so Honcho can hold both a peer's view of itself and **peer X's understanding of peer Y**. That matters for multi-agent setups where agents shouldn't share everything.

## How Honcho's memory pipeline works

Honcho splits into two services, per its architecture section:

- **Storage** is synchronous: workspaces, peers, sessions and messages, written through the API.
- **Insights** is asynchronous: a background worker called the **deriver** consumes a queue and produces conclusions, representations, summaries and peer cards. It also runs **dreaming**, a background consolidation task.

The loop the README describes:

1. **Store** conversations, events, documents or tool traces as messages on a session.
2. **Reason.** The deriver processes the queue and updates peer representations.
3. **Query.** Ask for context, search results, a representation, or a natural-language answer.
4. **Inject** the result into any LLM call.

What you can read back:

- **Conclusions**: deductive and inductive statements Honcho has derived about a peer.
- **Representations**: low-latency snapshots of what Honcho knows, optionally per session.
- **Peer cards**: compact identity summaries.
- **Session context**: prompt-ready bundles with summaries, sized to a token budget.
- **Chat endpoint** (the "dialectic" settings in the config): a reasoning model that answers questions about a peer, at a reasoning level from `minimal` to `max`.

Because reasoning is asynchronous, new messages take a moment to show up in chat answers. The docs suggest the representation endpoint for low-latency reads. Search over messages is hybrid BM25 plus vector.

## Using Honcho from Python

This follows the README quickstart and matches `honcho-ai` 2.5.1:

```python
import os
from honcho import Honcho
from openai import OpenAI

honcho = Honcho(
    workspace_id="tutoring-app",
    api_key=os.environ["HONCHO_API_KEY"],  # self-hosted: base_url="http://localhost:8000"
)

student = honcho.peer("student-42")
tutor = honcho.peer("tutor")
session = honcho.session("lesson-1")

session.add_messages([
    student.message("Can you explain fractions with a picture? Text walls lose me."),
    tutor.message("Sure, let's draw a pizza cut into eight slices."),
])

# Natural-language question about the peer (answered by Honcho's reasoning)
print(student.chat("How does this student prefer to learn?", reasoning_level="low"))

# Prompt-ready context for the next turn, capped at a token budget
context = session.context(summary=True, tokens=4_000)
reply = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=context.to_openai(assistant=tutor),
)
print(reply.choices[0].message.content)
```

`peer.search(...)`, `peer.representation(...)` and `peer.card()` give the other read paths. `student.chat(..., target=tutor)` asks what one peer knows about another. A `to_anthropic()` formatter exists alongside `to_openai()`.

## Self-hosting Honcho

Three ways to run it:

1. **Managed** at api.honcho.dev. Each organization gets its own dedicated Honcho instance, per the README.
2. **Local stack with the CLI**: `uv tool install honcho-cli`, then `honcho start --setup`. It writes your LLM provider key and starts the API, the deriver, Postgres and Redis in Docker.
3. **From source**: clone the repo, copy `docker-compose.yml.example` and `.env.template`, add LLM keys, and run `docker compose up`.

Honcho needs **PostgreSQL with pgvector**. It uses several model providers by default: Gemini for the deriver, summaries and low reasoning levels; Anthropic for higher reasoning levels and dreaming; and OpenAI for embeddings. Each can be reconfigured. Running a self-hosted instance means running those LLM calls on your own keys.

The **AGPL-3.0** license is worth checking with your legal team. It requires you to share source changes if you offer a modified Honcho to users over a network.

## Integrations for coding agents

Honcho ships first-party memory plugins for **Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, OpenClaw** and the DeepSeek Harness, and it's built into **Hermes Agent** as a memory provider (`hermes memory setup`). All of them read one `~/.honcho/config.json`, so pointing two tools at the same workspace gives them shared memory. A hosted MCP server at mcp.honcho.dev covers other clients. See [Hermes Agent memory](/articles/hermes-agent-memory/) and OpenClaw memory for how Honcho compares with other providers there.

## Honcho benchmark results

Plastic Labs publishes evals at [honcho.dev/evals](https://honcho.dev/evals/), with configurations in the `plastic-labs/honcho-benchmarks` repo:

| Benchmark | Honcho | Claude Haiku 4.5 with full context |
|---|---|---|
| LongMemEval-S | 90.4% | 62.6% |
| LoCoMo | 89.9% | 75.6% |
| BEAM 100K | 0.630 | 0.533 |
| BEAM 10M | 0.409 | not reported |

The default setup used gemini-2.5-flash-lite for the deriver and claude-haiku-4.5 for dreaming and chat. These are **self-reported** results, graded by an LLM judge, and other vendors use different models and judges. Our [LLM memory comparison](/articles/llm-memory-comparison/) lists claims side by side, and [LLM memory evaluation](/articles/llm-memory-evaluation/) explains the benchmarks.

## When Honcho fits

Honcho fits when understanding the person matters more than recalling a fact: tutors, coaches, companions, and support agents that should adapt to how each user thinks. It's also one of the few systems that models what one agent knows about another, which helps in multi-agent apps.

It fits less well when you need document RAG, explicit fact validity windows, or a permissive license. Mem0 and Graphiti (Apache 2.0) and Hindsight (MIT) are alternatives with different memory models; see [Supermemory alternatives](/articles/supermemory-alternatives/) and Mem0 alternatives.
