faq:
- question: "How does Hermes Agent memory work?"
  answer: "Hermes keeps two small files in ~/.hermes/memories/: MEMORY.md for the agent's notes (2,200 characters) and USER.md for the user profile (1,375 characters). Both load into the system prompt as a frozen snapshot at session start. Past sessions are stored in SQLite and searched on demand with the session_search tool."
- question: "Why doesn't Hermes remember what I just told it?"
  answer: "Memory writes save to disk right away but only appear in the system prompt in the next session, because the snapshot is frozen to keep the prompt cache stable. Run /new to start a fresh session and reload it. Also check that memory_enabled is true and that the store isn't full."
- question: "Which external memory providers does Hermes Agent support?"
  answer: "As of October 2026 the docs list Honcho, OpenViking, Mem0, Hindsight, Holographic, RetainDB, ByteRover, Supermemory and Memori. Only one external provider can be active at a time, and it runs alongside the built-in MEMORY.md and USER.md."

**Hermes Agent memory** is two small, agent-curated files plus a searchable history. `MEMORY.md` (2,200 characters) holds the agent's own notes and `USER.md` (1,375 characters) holds your profile. Both load into the system prompt at session start. Older conversations live in SQLite and are searched on demand. One optional external provider can add more.

[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) is an open-source (MIT) agent from Nous Research that runs in a terminal or through messaging apps and creates reusable skills from its own experience. This page covers each layer of its memory, the external providers, and what to check when memory seems broken. Details come from the official [Hermes memory docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/memory), checked October 2026.

## What is Hermes Agent memory?

**Hermes Agent memory is a bounded, curated store that persists across sessions. The agent decides what to save, writes short entries into MEMORY.md and USER.md through a memory tool, and Hermes injects both files into the system prompt as a frozen block when each session starts.**

The design is small on purpose. Together the two files are about 1,300 tokens, always in context. Everything else (full transcripts, old tasks) stays out of the prompt until the agent searches for it. That split between always-loaded memory and on-demand recall is the same one described in [AI agent memory explained](/articles/ai-agent-memory-explained/).

## The layers of Hermes memory

| Layer | Where it lives | Size | When it's in context |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MEMORY.md** | `~/.hermes/memories/` | 2,200 chars (~800 tokens) | Every session, as a frozen snapshot |
| **USER.md** | `~/.hermes/memories/` | 1,375 chars (~500 tokens) | Every session, as a frozen snapshot |
| **Session history** | `~/.hermes/state.db` (SQLite, FTS5) | Unlimited | Only when the agent calls `session_search` |
| **Skills** | Skills directory | Per skill | When a skill is relevant |
| **External provider** | Depends on provider | Depends | Prefetched before each turn |

With profiles, the files sit under `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/memories/` instead.

### MEMORY.md and USER.md

**MEMORY.md** is for the agent's working knowledge: environment facts, project conventions, tool quirks and techniques that worked. **USER.md** is for you: name, role, timezone, communication style, pet peeves and technical level. The docs say to skip trivial facts, things that are easy to look up again, raw data dumps, and anything already in `SOUL.md` or `AGENTS.md`.

Entries are separated by `§`. The injected block has a header showing usage (for example 67%, 1,474 of 2,200 characters), so the model knows how full the store is.

### The memory tool

The agent edits memory with one tool and three actions:

1. **add**: append a new entry.
2. **replace**: find an entry by a unique substring (`old_text`) and overwrite it.
3. **remove**: delete the entry matching `old_text`.

There's no read action, since the content is already in the prompt. Exact duplicates are rejected. When a write would go over the limit, the tool returns an error with the current entries, and the agent must send one batch of operations that frees space and adds the new entry. Hermes never compacts memory on its own. The docs suggest consolidating once usage passes 80%.

Every entry is scanned for prompt injection, credential exfiltration, SSH backdoors and invisible Unicode before it's saved. That matters because memory is a known attack surface; see [AI memory injection](/articles/ai-memory-injection/).

### Session search

Past CLI and messaging sessions are stored in `~/.hermes/state.db`. The `session_search` tool runs full-text search (SQLite FTS5) over them and returns raw messages, and the agent can scroll through a found session. `hermes sessions list` shows them from the CLI. This is Hermes's answer to "what did we do last month": not stored in memory, but findable.

### Background review and write approval

After a conversation, a background review can update memory and skills. It's on by default (`auxiliary.background_review.enabled`), uses the main model unless you set another, and caps input at 75% of the model's context window (up to 600,000 tokens). If you want to approve writes, set `memory.write_approval: true`; staged writes then appear under `/memory pending` and can be approved or rejected.

## Configuring Hermes memory

Settings live in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
memory:
  memory_enabled: true
  user_profile_enabled: true
  memory_char_limit: 2200
  user_char_limit: 1375
  write_approval: false
  # provider: honcho   # optional external provider
```

Turning off both `memory_enabled` and `user_profile_enabled` removes the memory tool entirely. You can raise the character limits, but every character is paid for on every turn, so bigger isn't free.

The `/journey` command (also `hermes journey`) shows a timeline of skills and memory entries, and `hermes journey delete <node>` removes one.

## External memory providers

Hermes can run **one external provider at a time** next to the built-in files. When one is active, Hermes prefetches relevant memories before each turn, syncs turns after each response, extracts memories at session end where supported, and mirrors built-in memory writes to it. The [memory providers page](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/memory-providers) lists nine as of October 2026:

| Provider | What it does (per Hermes docs) | Hosting | Tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Honcho** (Plastic Labs) | Cross-session user modeling with dialectic reasoning | Cloud or self-hosted | 5 |
| **OpenViking** (Volcengine) | Context database with a filesystem-style hierarchy | Self-hosted, AGPL-3.0 | 6 |
| **Mem0** | LLM fact extraction with semantic search and dedup | Cloud, self-hosted or in-process | 4 |
| **Hindsight** (Vectorize) | Long-term memory with knowledge graph and entity resolution | Cloud, embedded Postgres or local server | 3 |
| **Holographic** | Local SQLite fact store with FTS5, trust scoring and HRR algebra | Local only | 2 |
| **RetainDB** | Cloud memory API with hybrid search | Cloud ($20/month listed) | 10 |
| **ByteRover** | Local-first memory via the `brv` CLI | Local, optional cloud sync | 3 |
| **Supermemory** | Semantic long-term memory with profile recall | Cloud or self-hosted | 4 |
| **Memori** (Memori Labs) | Structured long-term memory | Memori Cloud | 5 |

Holographic, RetainDB and ByteRover are bundled today, but the docs say they "leave core" on October 15, 2026. The others install with `hermes plugins install <name>`. Holographic uses holographic reduced representations, explained in [holographic memory for AI agents](/articles/holographic-memory-ai-agent/), and Honcho has its own page on [Honcho LLM memory](/articles/honcho-llm-memory/).

Setup is the same for each:

```bash
hermes plugins install honcho   # or mem0, hindsight, supermemory, openviking
hermes memory setup             # interactive picker and credentials
hermes memory status            # confirm which provider is active
hermes memory off               # disable the external provider
```

How to choose: pick **Honcho** if modeling the user is the point, **Mem0** or **Supermemory** for a hosted fact store with little setup, **Hindsight** if you want memories consolidated into evidence-backed observations plus a reflect call, and **Holographic** or **ByteRover** if nothing may leave the machine. If the built-in files already hold what you need, skip providers entirely; they add LLM calls and a dependency.

## Hermes memory not working: what to check

Most "Hermes forgot" reports come from a handful of causes:

1. **The snapshot is frozen.** Writes save to disk at once but show up in the prompt only next session. Run `/new` to reload. Messaging gateways (Telegram, Discord) are one long session until you reset them.
2. **The store is full.** At 2,200 or 1,375 characters, new adds fail until the agent consolidates. Check usage in the header or open the files.
3. **Memory is disabled.** Confirm `memory_enabled` and `user_profile_enabled` in `config.yaml`, and that `memory` isn't listed under `agent.disabled_toolsets`.
4. **Writes are staged.** With `write_approval: true`, nothing lands until you approve it under `/memory pending`.
5. **Wrong profile.** Each profile has its own memory directory.
6. **The detail was never memory.** Long task history belongs in session search, so ask the agent to search past sessions.
7. **Provider problems.** Run `hermes memory status`. Only one provider can be active, and cloud providers need their credentials (RetainDB, for example, reads `RETAINDB_API_KEY` from `~/.hermes/.env`).

## Hermes compared with other agents

Hermes's built-in memory is closest to OpenClaw's markdown files and Claude Code's auto memory: plain text, small, loaded at start. It differs in the hard character caps and the frozen snapshot. Hermes can also import from OpenClaw with `hermes claw migrate`, which carries over `SOUL.md`, memories, skills and `AGENTS.md`. For a side-by-side, see [OpenClaw vs Hermes Agent memory](/articles/openclaw-vs-hermes-agent-memory/).
